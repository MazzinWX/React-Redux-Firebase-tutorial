React Redux & Firebase tutorial


Started 06/05/2019

Various steps:
    - Understand React and how components work
    - Add redux middleware (Thunk)
    - Create firebase DB and connect it

It's a good base to undestand NoSql databases and help to start with Rethinkdb ;)

Redux & Async code:
 To better understand Async communication, we use a middleware => "Thunk".
  Thunk:
    - Halts the dispatch
    - Perform async request 
    - Resume dispatch
